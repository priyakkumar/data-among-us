Sometimes it’s hard to see the data right before our eyes. In this session, we’ll talk about ways for people to find sources of inspiration for data-driven stories within communities they cover, even if no dataset currently exists.

We’ll talk about how to look for patterns in everyday occurrences to create structured datasets out of text, images, public statements and more, which can enrich and inform our storytelling. We’ll also look at some surprising data sets that already exist and discuss how to incorporate them into our own coverage and use them find new story ideas. Together, we’ll brainstorm data-driven stories inspired by what we find during our stay in Minneapolis, around SRCCON, or even the just in the room we’re in. We’ll workshop some of those ideas and expand the discussion to incorporate them into possible stories in our own communities. We’ll also talk about how to get the rest of your newsroom to think in a data-driven mindset while reporting, and leave with some story ideas to take back with us.

## What can data stories cover?
#### Serious things
* [FiveThirtyEight’s Congress Tracker](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/)
* [New York Times: Tracking the Health Care Vote](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/07/25/us/politics/senate-vote-republican-health-care-bill.html?_r=1)

#### Less serious things
* [LA Times: Every Kobe Shot Ever](http://graphics.latimes.com/kobe-every-shot-ever/)
* [Pudding.cool: Analyzing Hamilton Lyrics](https://pudding.cool/2017/03/hamilton/)

#### Not so serious things
* [Bloomberg: Fast and Furious Data](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2017-fast-and-furious/)
* [Vulture: 30 Years of Movie Villains](http://www.vulture.com/2017/06/30-years-action-movie-villains-11-infographics.html)

## Collecting your own data -- why bother?

#### Useful as a reference point for readers and reporters
* [Tracking Congress in the age of Trump](https://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/congress-trump-score/) - 538 

#### Turn anecdotal evidence into a real story
* “It sure seems like Trump spends a lot of time at his own properties” vs. [“Trump has spent 30% of his presidency at a Trump property.”](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/04/05/us/politics/tracking-trumps-visits-to-his-branded-properties.html?_r=0)
* “The single-rider line at Disneyland looks like it has a short wait time” vs. [“The wait in the single rider line is 66 minutes shorter.”](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-fi-disneyland-ride-wait-time/)
* “I see the pizza emoji on Venmo a lot” vs. [“The pizza emoji was used 17,470 times in one week”](https://qz.com/359903/the-emoji-of-venmo/)

#### Create a web for more stories
* If Trump spent the last 7 weekends at Mar-a-Lago, how much does that cost Secret Service / taxpayers?
* Why is the [pot industry](http://www.latimes.com/politics/essential/la-pol-ca-essential-politics-updates-the-cannabis-industry-has-a-clear-1501179643-htmlstory.html) only donating to Gavin Newsom's [campaign for governor](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-california-governor-2018-money/)?

#### More opportunities for reader engagement

Even a tiny bit of structure can lead to higher reader engagement/involvement
* [How will California's new laws affect my job/my health/my commute?](http://www.latimes.com/projects/la-pol-ca-new-2017-laws/)
* [The 351 People, Places and Things Donald Trump Has Insulted on Twitter: A Complete List](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/01/28/upshot/donald-trump-twitter-insults.html)
