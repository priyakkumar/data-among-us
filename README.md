Sometimes it’s hard to see the data right before our eyes. In this session, we’ll talk about ways for people to find sources of inspiration for data-driven stories within communities they cover, even if no dataset currently exists.

We’ll talk about how to look for patterns in everyday occurrences to create structured datasets out of text, images, public statements and more, which can enrich and inform our storytelling. We’ll also look at some surprising data sets that already exist and discuss how to incorporate them into our own coverage and use them find new story ideas. Together, we’ll brainstorm data-driven stories inspired by what we find during our stay in Minneapolis, around SRCCON, or even the just in the room we’re in. We’ll workshop some of those ideas and expand the discussion to incorporate them into possible stories in our own communities. We’ll also talk about how to get the rest of your newsroom to think in a data-driven mindset while reporting, and leave with some story ideas to take back with us.
